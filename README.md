## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Start the server for serving or you can say simply run an express server on a defined port for listening. I am using node and the server is defined in server.js file.
Perform request to get a response from it.

### `npm run dev`

Run the server in development mode so if you perform and change in a file you don't need to terminate the server and start again, nodemon will handle that every time you save the file.

### `npm run migrate`

Migrate Scripts to run postgrator and for creating tables in database and if required we can undo them too by provided scripts.

### `npm run predeploy`

For running a command before deploying. this command will fix all the error before deploying the app to Heroku.

### `npm run deploy`

For deploying the API endpoint to Heroku
